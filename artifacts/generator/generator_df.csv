Is hilter dead ?,""" Donovan on a brief visit to the UK; he became convinced the UK would survive and should be supported in every possible way. [ 279 ] [ 280 ] Before the end of the year, American journalist Ralph Ingersoll , after returning from Britain, published a book concluding that ""Adolf Hitler met his first defeat in eight years"" in what might ""go down in history as a battle as important as Waterloo or Gettysburg "". The turning point was when the Germans reduced the intensity of daylight attacks after 15 September. According to Ingersoll, ""[a] majority of responsible British officers who fought through this battle believe that if Hitler and Göring had had the courage and the resources to lose 200 planes a day for the next five days, nothing could have saved London""; instead, ""[the Luftwaffe's] morale in combat is definitely broken, and the RAF has been gaining in strength each week."" [ 281 ] Both sides in the battle made exaggerated claims of numbers of enemy aircraft shot down. In general, clai

109Es until October 1940. On 14 September, Hitler chaired a meeting with the OKW staff. Göring was in France directing the decisive battle, so Erhard Milch deputised for him. [ 243 ] Hitler asked ""Should we call it off altogether?"" General Hans Jeschonnek , Luftwaffe Chief of Staff, begged for a last chance to defeat the RAF and for permission to launch attacks on civilian residential areas to cause mass panic. Hitler refused the latter, perhaps unaware of how much damage had already been done to civilian targets. He reserved for himself the power to unleash the terror weapon. Instead, political will was to be broken by destroying the material infrastructure, the weapons industry, and stocks of fuel and food. On 15 September, two massive waves of German attacks were decisively repulsed by the RAF by deploying every aircraft in 11 Group. Sixty German and twenty-six RAF aircraft were shot down. The action was the climax of the Battle of Britain. [ 244 ] Two days after this German defeat

According to a report by the Relief Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Health and Welfare in 1964, combined Japanese Army and Navy deaths during the war (1937–1945) numbered approximately 2,121,000 men, mostly against either the Americans (over 1 million), or against Chinese factions (over 500,000).

Wolfram von Richthofen became an exponent of air power providing ground support to other services. [ 27 ] The difficulty of accurately hitting targets prompted Ernst Udet to require that all new bombers had to be dive bombers , and led to the development of the Knickebein system for night time navigation. Priority was given to producing large numbers of smaller aeroplanes, and plans for a long-range, four-engined strategic bomber were cancelled.

The speed with which German forces defeated most of the defending armies in Norway in early 1940 created a significant political crisis in Britain. In early May 1940, the Norway Debate questioned the fitness for office of the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain . On 10 May, the same day Winston Churchill became British Prime Minister, the Germans initiated the Battle of France with an aggressive invasion of French territory. RAF Fighter Command was desperately short of trained pilots and aircraft. Churchill sent fighter squadrons, the Air Component of the British Expeditionary Force , to support operations in France, [ 29 ] where the RAF suffered heavy losses. This was despite the objections of its commander Hugh Dowding that the diversion of his forces would leave home defences under-strength. [ 30 ] After the evacuation of British and French

[ 289 ] The British victory in the Battle of Britain was achieved at a heavy cost. Total British civilian losses from July to December 1940 were 23,002 dead and 32,138 wounded, with one of the largest single raids on 19 December 1940, in which almost 3,000 civilians died.

In 1935 Hermann Göring welcomed news that Britain, as a potential ally, was rearming. In 1936 he promised assistance to defend the British Empire, asking only a free hand in Eastern Europe, and repeated this to Lord Halifax in 1937. That year, von Ribbentrop met Churchill with a similar proposal; when rebuffed, he told Churchill that interference with German domination would mean war.

It was the first major military campaign fought entirely by air forces.

I expect that the Battle of Britain is about to begin."" [ 14 ] The Germans had rapidly overwhelmed France and the Low Countries in the Battle of France , leaving Britain to face the threat of invasion by sea. The German high command recognised the difficulties of a seaborne attack while the Royal Navy controlled the English Channel and the North Sea .

In the spring of 1945, after the final defeat of Germany , the Labour Party withdrew from the wartime coalition government , to oust Winston Churchill , forcing a general election . Following a landslide victory, Labour held more than 60% of the seats in the House of Commons and formed a new government on 26 July 1945 under Clement Attlee , who had been Deputy Prime Minister in the coalition government. Britain's war debt was described by some in the American administration as a ""millstone round the neck of the British economy"". Although there were suggestions for an international conference to tackle the issue, in August 1945 the U.S. announced unexpectedly that the Lend-Lease programme was to end immediately. The abrupt withdrawal of American Lend-Lease support to Britain on 2 September 1945 dealt a severe blow to the plans of the new government.
